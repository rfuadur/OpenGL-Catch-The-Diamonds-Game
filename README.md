## 📝 Project Overview
This project is a 2D interactive arcade game developed using **Python** and **OpenGL**. Unlike standard sprite-based games, this engine manually renders all geometric shapes (diamonds, catcher, buttons) using the **Midpoint Line Drawing Algorithm**.

The objective is simple: control the catcher at the bottom of the screen to collect falling diamonds while avoiding misses. The game features dynamic difficulty scaling, state management (Pause/Play), and custom UI buttons.

## ✨ Key Technical Features
* **Midpoint Line Algorithm:** All visual elements are drawn pixel-by-pixel using the 8-way symmetry Midpoint Line Drawing Algorithm (converted from Zone 0).
* **AABB Collision Detection:** Implements Axis-Aligned Bounding Box logic to detect intersections between the falling diamonds and the catcher.
* **State Management:** Handles multiple game states including `PLAYING`, `PAUSED`, and `GAME_OVER`.
* **Dynamic Difficulty:** The speed of falling diamonds increases automatically as the player's score rises.
* **Interactive UI:** Features clickable buttons (Restart, Pause, Exit) rendered directly in the OpenGL window.

## 🎮 Controls
The game supports Keyboard and Mouse interactions:

| Input | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Left Arrow (←)** | Move Left | Moves the catcher to the left. |
| **Right Arrow (→)** | Move Right | Moves the catcher to the right. |
| **Mouse Click** | Interact UI | Click the on-screen buttons (Restart ⟳, Pause ⏯, Exit ✖). |
